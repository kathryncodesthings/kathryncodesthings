## Welcome

I'm a qualifed accountant with 10+ years' experience in various accounting and data-related roles. I'm especially interested in how to ensure that the right data is communicated in the most clear and informative way, to ensure better decisions get made.

See some of my work below:
* Analysing publicly available financial information on UK universities and performing statistical analysis: [HESA KFIs analysis](https://github.com/kathryncodesthings/HESA-KFIs-project)
* Improving a revenue visualisation: [Revenue visualisation improvement](https://github.com/kathryncodesthings/improving-data-visualisation)
* Using web scraping and other public data to estimate financial risks to UK universities: [Web scraping and risk estimates](https://github.com/kathryncodesthings/Web-scraping-fees-project)
* Analysing data about a game show (Taskmaster) and using machine learning to try to forecast results: [Taskmaster machine learning predictions](https://github.com/kathryncodesthings/taskmaster-predictions-with-machine-learning)

My particular interests and skills are:
- data visualisation, particularly financial data
  - including dashboards 
- communicating insights to non-technical audiences
- data cleaning and transformation

To do this I use a variety of tools:
- top-tier Excel skills
- Power BI (and extensive use of Power Query)
- Python for data tasks (analysis, visualisation, etc.) 

I also have some experience with:
- Tableau
- Alteryx
- SQL
